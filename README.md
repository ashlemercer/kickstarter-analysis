# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data to Uncover Trends

### Overview
In this analysis, we examined an extensive amount of crowdfunding projects to pinpoint any trends that would help our client, Louise, successfully launch and fund her own kickstarter for a play that she wants to put on. From here, Louise requested to see trends that helped other campaigns be successful based on their launch dates and goals set.

### Analysis and Challenges
To begin, we took a look at a variety of kickstarter data that included film, technology, food, etc., and found that theatre was the most popular type, making up 912 out of the 3,038 kickstarters, thus giving us more concrete trends to observe.  

From here, we narrowed the data down to specifically look at Theatre Outcomes based on two things per Louises request: **Launch Date** and **Goals.**

### Results

**Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date:**
For this section, we created a pivot chart looking at the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater kickstarters depending on which month they were launched. There was a very clear indication that the most promising time to launch a kickstarter would be May, which showed 111 out of 166 projects proving successful, while launching a kickstarter in December or October would be the least successful. This is indicated in the line graph below in the gap between May's successful vs failed, compared to December's which are practically overlapping on the graph, or October which has the most number of failed kickstarters.To be safe, it would best to avoid launching from September-January.

**Theater Outcomes Based on Goals:**
For this section, we again organized the number of successful/failed/and canceled kickstarters based on 12 different goal ranges and turned those categories into percentages based on the total amount of projects. From here, we visualized this into a line graph to easily compare. We can confidently report to Louise that keeping her goal range under $4,999 will be most successful. Goals set at $45,000 had a 100% percentage of failure, so surely stay away from that amount. Keeping the goal attainable seems to be key here.
